I'd planned to write a post that would be a retrospective on my job search after signing my contract, but due to developments in the world at large, I don't really have the heart. 

<!--summary-->
The important part is that I am _thrilled_ to be joining the University of Vermont as a tenure track Assistant Professor in January 2021! I have _so many_ thoughts about the process, and especially the timeline, as someone who was in a dual-career search. [My partner](http://jjfoley.me) will be joining Middlebury College, also in a tenure track Assistant Professor position, in July 2020.  

Of course, given the current current climate, society could collapse, colleges could permantly close, etc., so who really knows what's going to happen?

In any case, I delayed my start date so that I could crawl out of my grad student shell and do some civic duties, like working for an election. At least, this was my thinking about a month ago -- at the moment, like everyone else, I have no idea what is going to happen, and am just taking things one day at a time. The most important thing right now is for me to wrap up my dissertation, and defend via Zoom (suddenly scheduling seems like it is going to get a lot easier ::fingers crossed::), and be there (emotionally, not physically) for people. 

Stay safe, everyone, and take care of each other.
