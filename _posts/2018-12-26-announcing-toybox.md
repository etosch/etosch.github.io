Well, this blog post is only a few weeks late. Fortunately my excitement hasn't waned: I'm psyched to write about a project I've effectively been working on since May of this year.

I'm working with [John](http://jjfoley.me), [Kaleigh](http://cs.umass.edu/~kclary), and [David](http://cs.umass.edu/~jensen) on a new testing framework for deep reinforcement learning. We presented a version of the work at NeurIPS this year, and are submitting it to a software engineering conference soon. It's called [~~ Toybox ~~](https://github.com/KDL-umass/Toybox), it's written in Rust, and there's more cool information about it on my [Projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects.html).

# Context: My below the fold backstory
*Alternative header: Yes, yes, the past two years have been a crapshoot for everyone, I'm not special.*

2017 was a rough year for me. Hell, the past three years have all been rough in some capacity. However, in November 2016, it was like a switch flipped and all coins were suddenly weighted. At some point I may write more about specifics, but let's just say that for a while starting that November, it felt like there was no choice I could make that wouldn't lead to a dreadful outcome. I'm someone who values agency in my life and (apparently rather foolishly) believes that everyone is a rational actor. It didn't help that the rest of the world also felt like things went upside-down.

As a consequence of some professional turmoil, my research progress slowed. Well...kind of. I certainly kept working at my usual pace, but my topic was a slog and the political situation around it was very stressful to deal with. I started running much more seriously and found it was pretty much the only way I could manage the near daily dose of what I now view as comically batshit shoes dropping.

I enjoyed TAing CS240 again in Spring 2017, and it was great relief to find fufillment from something other than my research topic. Given various resource constraints (time, money, compute, sanity), I didn't have bandwidth to do much research that semester anyway. That summer, I did some project assistant work related to education and started picking up the pace, research-wise again. I then TAed the graduate Logic course in Fall of 2018 and had a bike accident during the 2018 Bike Fest in September. This was not great timing, given that running remained my prime source of stress relief. Nonetheless, I was able to submit a conference paper (it was rejected -- this was the second time). During all of 2017, I worked quite a lot on my dissertation proposal and yes, Virginia, I do believe this was a painful waste of my time. Live and learn.

In Spring 2018, I co-taught 240. This is a required course for the undergraduate major. I have a lot to say about that experience, which I will save for another post, but the important part for this post is that prepping courses is super time consuming and teaching well is at least 70% social work. I think about 10% of my class was in some kind of crisis at any given time, which for a class of 180 students is the size of a full liberal arts college class. I have many thoughts regarding this, but for now -- definitely no research happening!

Anyway, that brings me to May of this year...

# Hello, XAI!
In Fall 2017, I began sitting in the [Knowledge Discovery Lab](https://kdl.cs.umass.edu), where a bunch of awesome people are working on explainable AI. As a lab, KDL specializes in causal inference, empirical methods, and relational learning. Folks in the lab have had a growing interest in collaboration possiblities with systems folks. One of their most recent projects has been to use systems data for evaluating causal inference metrics (see [Amanda Gentzel](https://cs.umass.edu/~agentzel)'s work). They are also addressing some really interesting work in probabilistic programming languages -- specifically pertaining to whether PPLscan express causal models that aren't expressible as causal graphical models (see [Sam Witty](https://cs.umass.edu/~switty)'s work).

As for where I fit into this, I'm bringing the systems brawn and knowledge of experimentation system minutae to the XAI project. We have a few more systems-y projects in the pipeline and I'm pretty pumped to write about about them soon!
